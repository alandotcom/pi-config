# pstack-arena

The user explicitly selected the arena workflow. Read [the pstack entrypoint](../../SKILL.md), then [the arena instructions](../../references/upstream/arena/SKILL.md), including their linked execution contract and applicable references. Execute this workflow for the user's request, even when the session's ordinary routing would not select it. This invocation does not change the session level or saved default. Repository scope, approval rules, and any assigned leaf role still apply.
